# SegmentationWizard - 3D Slicer

This is a module developed for 3D Slicer by the Quantitative Tumor Imaging Lab at the Martinos Center (QTIM). Its goal is to provide easy and effecient manual segmentation of regions-of-interest for medical images, particularly those with high slice resolution. SegmentationWizard accomplishes this through the automatic creation of 3D region-of-interest 'models' using ITK's Delaunay Triangulation Method, as well as subtraction mapping and editing features already present in Slicer. In the future, we plan to add additional workflows to the SegmentationWizard for automatic deep learning segmentations of different tissues relevant to the clinicians, integration with 3D Slicer's Segmentations Module, and the ability to segment multiple volumes.

The model-creation method has been lifted from the previous Slicer module 'VolumeCrop' by Andrey Fedorov and Ron Kikinis at https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/CropVolume. The UI and skeleton of this module has been based off Slicer's ChangeTracker module created by Andrey Fedorov at https://github.com/fedorov/ChangeTrackerPy. This module was worked on as part of Winter Project Week 2017, hosted by NA-MIC [LINK].
